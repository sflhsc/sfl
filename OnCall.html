	  <li><b>How do I book an On Call Tutoring session?</b></li>
	  On Call Tutoring is easy to set up! Just click on the link above and you will be taken to a professional booking website where you will be able to select your preferred time. Each session is one hour by default and starts at the time you selected. For example, if you choose 6:00 pm on Wednesday, Sept 30th, the tutoring session will be from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm on Sept 30th. We will contact you within 2 business days to confirm the location of the session.

	<li><b>How would I pay for my booked session?</b></li>
You can pay directly on our website as you book. Your payment is processed via Stripe, a payment system used by high-profile services such as Fitbit, Twitter, Reddit and The Guardian. If you would like to book in person, swing by one of our general tutoring sessions at the times listed on our home page and we would be happy to help you out.

	<li><b>How do I reschedule or cancel?</b></li>
You can easily cancel up to 24 hours before the booked session. This is done by simply clicking on the "CANCEL this booking" link at the end of your confirmation email. If you need to reschedule, simply cancel the booked session and book a different one. You will refunded 100% upon cancelling your sessions.


	<li><b>Helping out the community</b></li>
All proceeds are used to improve Students for Learningâ€™s community outreach program. With your support, we will continue to expand our operations into more high schools and recruit more tutors. Last year we saved students over $2000 on average in tutoring fees and we have set a goal of tripling that number this year. Thank you for your support.
